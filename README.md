# Image-Based Steganography 
A Secure and efficient Python-based Steganography tool , that hides secret messages inside the images , while keeping them visually unchanged. This Project is higly used in Cybersecurity and other organizations who ensures safe and secure data communication. 
# Features
## No Need to Manually provide Message Length 
    ### Many projects require users to input the message length separately. 
    ### But this stores at first pixel , making decryption automated
## Built-in Password Protection 
	  ### Many basic implementation lack security 
	  ### But this requires a passcode for decryption , avoiding unauthorized users
## Lightweight and Flexible 
	  ### Some tools depend on external libraries or work only with PNG images
	  ### But this requires OpenCV and Supports multiple formats (JPG, PNG, etc.,)
# Installation 
  1. Install the required library:
     pip install opencv-python
# Future Scope 
  1. Stronger Encryption     - Add RSA to make messages more secure 
  2. Increased Data Storage  - Enable hiding files, not just text, for greater utility
  3. AI detection Resistance - Implement advanced encoding to evade detection tools
